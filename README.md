# AESO-app-public
Dash app for AESO generation data viz and analysis

Link to dash: https://aeso-app-public.onrender.com (first load takes a couple of minutes due to host service unfreezing).

Thanks for checking out my dash app! Raw data files are available in /assets but in order to host the dash for free I've adapted my code to make a condensed dataset called "mini_df.csv" from which all visualization are made. 

Updates are constantly being rolled out and if you have questions, comments or suggestions, please contact me at: akirkey2@gmail.com!
